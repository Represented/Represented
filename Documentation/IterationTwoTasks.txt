Tom and Charlie
	FEED PAGE
	(getLegislationByLegislationID)...
	When feed page loads, need to make a query to get reps by location
	Then need content to display on feed: get legislation by reps
		just make sure that we are only getting legislation that 
		corresponds to those three representatives; skip all other legislation
	
	LEGISLATION
	getLegislationDataByBillID()
	
	REPRESENTATIVE
	getInformationAboutRepresentative()
	getLegislationByRepresentative() // actions of representative
	getVotesByRepresentative()
	
	all of this will be stored into object arrays used to populate timelines/other views
	these are the big messy objects that have more fields that we are going to use for the views
	
	Need a different service for each query;
	Each service represents a call to the Sunlight API
	These are stored in src/app/
	
	Need to learn promises and observables for angular
	Need to learn Typescript too maybe?
	
	We are making the services to contain the queries

Michael and Ben:
	cleanup src/app cause it's getting messy
	create stubs for each query so that we know exactly which queries that
	we need to provide

Greg
	Cookies
	Run cookie check: if it passes, go to feed page
	if not, go to welcome screen
	make sure this is well-defined
	What if friend who doesn't have cookie goes to non-welcome-page URL?

Aaron
	Routing; make sure that you go to welcome page if you don't have cookie

Jacob
	Trying to setup a production server to replace lite-server on the
	DO droplet

	a.k.a. get Forever server to work
